# Power-BI-Dashboard-Project
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data to help stakeholders make informed business decisions. The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPIs), interactive visuals, and detailed insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and product performance.

# KPI'S REQUIREMENT 
We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics: 1. Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders. 
3. Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold. 
4. Total Orders: The total number of orders placed. 
5. Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.
